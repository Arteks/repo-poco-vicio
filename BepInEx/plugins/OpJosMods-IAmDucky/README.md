## I AM DUCKY!
- When you die each you will turn into a duck!
- Host must have mod for this to work

## Duck Controls
- **WASD** to walk of course
- **Space** to jump ...duh
- **E** to toggle on and off attack mode
- **C** to realign camera to duck, super useful sometimes if it gets all wonk
- **K** to kill the currently controlled duck and go back to spectating
- **B** toggles on **Blend** mode. Uses the Duck AI so its less obvious you control the duck
- Controls editable in config
